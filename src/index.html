        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
        Hi! My name is Alex and I am a recent graduate from UC Berkeley, where I majored in CS and applied math.
        I'll be a founding research scientist at <a href="https://lumalabs.ai">Luma AI</a> starting Spring 2022, and am also planning to start a PhD in Fall 2022.
        Until the end of winter, I'm working on 3D computer vision research with {{ autolink("Prof. Angjoo Kanazawa") }} in BAIR where I worked as a undergrad researcher.
        My research interest is at the intersection of vision and graphics. Recently, I am particularly interested in differentiable rendering and neural representations.
        </p>
        <p>
        During my undergrad, I also dabbled in CS theory, and worked on research in query complexity
        with Prof. Avishay Tal, without much success.
        Due to this I took many theory-related graduate classes, and was
        was also a member of the undergrad CS Theory club (UGTCS).
        </p>
        <p>
        Prior to Berkeley, I lived in Vancouver, Canada for many years.
        In fact,
        for my junior and senior years, I was based in the Vancouver area with my family and studying remotely.
