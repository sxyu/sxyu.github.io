    "abstract": "A generative video model that generates 120 frames of high-fidelity video from a image or text prompt, in under 120 seconds. Built on a transformer architecture and trained directly on videos, dream machine shows a promising level of 3D and physical consistency. We followed this with advanced control capabilities such as keyframe-control and looping."
